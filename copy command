Command to copying the entire folder recursively is:

COPY folder-to-copy/ /target/path/in/docker/image/

Above command will copy recursively all directories and files from given directory (folder-to-copy) to given path (/target/path/in/docker/image).

Itâ€™s little tricky because command:

COPY folder-to-copy/* /target/path/in/docker/image/
working not recursively.
